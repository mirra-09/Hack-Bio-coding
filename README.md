# Hack-Bio-coding
#Task Description 
This repository stores and prints details of our team members participating in the **HackBio Biocoding Internship** as part of our stage_zero task. 
Each team member's information is stored in a dictionary and displayed using formatted print statements.

## Team Members
The script contains details for the following members:
- Amaka Madubuike
- Balamirra Yegneswaran
- Precious-Gift Alele
- Samuel Eneojo Akor
- Danboyi Cynthia Ihotu

## How It Works
1. The script defines a dictionary `team_details`, where each member's data is stored.
2. The details are displayed using `print()` statements.
3. Running the script prints all team members' information neatly.
